    "keywords": "Getting Started This getting started guide will show you how to position GameObjects using the high-precision framework. 1. Install the Package First and foremost, install the high-precision framework package using the installation instructions . Once you have completed these steps, you will have a new or existing Unity project with the high-precision framework installed. 2. Create a New Scene Create a new scene in your project. This process can also be used to convert an existing scene. However, we recommend getting an understanding of the high-precision framework before doing so. In this scene, add two cube GameObjects and a camera which we will later position within a high-precision environment. 3. Remove Colliders Unfortunately, as of today, the high-precision framework does not work with the physics engine and can only be used for visualization purposes. For this reason, we will need to remove the colliders from both cube objects. 4. Add High-Precision Components Organize the scene using high-precision components. Create the high-precision Root Add an empty GameObject and call it HPRoot Add an HPRoot component Create a high-precision camera Add an HPTransform to the camera object Make the camera object a child of the HPRoot Create high-precision meshes Add an HPTransform to each of the cubes Make both cubes children of the HPRoot 5. Select a Rebasing Strategy The high-precision framework relies on a rebasing strategy to optimize the position of the GameObjects within the scene. The high-precision framework doesn't perform any magic, it only positions objects in a double-precision universe space to then translate them into Unity's world space where it is rendered using single-precision floating-point numbers. The rebasing strategy defines how the universe-space gets translated into world space. The high-precision framework comes with a LocalCoordinateSystem script which allows us to defined one of our high-precision objects as the object, in universe space, which will always remain very close to the center of our world space. Add this script to the HPRoot object and link the Origin object to the camera. Note: This script is an example of a simple rebasing strategy. The high-precision framework is designed such that any rebasing strategy can be implemented in a similar fashion. Use this script as an example. 6. High-Precision Scripting In order to take advantage of the high-precision framework, you will need to write scripts which position GameObjects within the universe space. To do so, you will need to start using the HPTransform 's API. When using the high-precision framework, you should no longer be using the default Transform 's API. With this setup, you only need to worry about the position of the objects within the universe. The high-precision framework, combined with the selected rebasing script will take care of positioning the objects within world-space for you."

    "keywords": "Known Limitations Platform Support Currently, only 64 bit windows is fully tested. However, the framework is reported to work on other platforms. Physics Physics can only work in a static rebasing context due to the performance cost of moving colliders. Navigation Mesh Authored navigation meshes can only be used in a static rebasing context. Particle Systems World-space particle simulations may or may not behave as expected depending on the rebasing strategy that is used by the high precision rendering scheme. If dynamic rebasing updates the HPRoot , particles simulated in world space will appear to jump around as a function of the rebasing. Scripts Any script that reads world-space positions will likely behave strangely when using the High Precision Framework. These scripts would need to be written such that only relative values are used or so that they use the HPTransform component rather than the Transform component. Shaders Shaders that rely on world space coordinates, such as tri-planar shaders will behave oddly when used with the High Precision Framework as the world space is constantly being adjusted with dynamic rebasing schemes."

    "keywords": "High Precision API The High Precision (HP) framework allows Unity to render very large worlds by providing a standard way of addressing the limitations of the single-precision floating point system that is used to position and render GameObjects within the engine. Notice Currently, only 64 bit windows version is supported. The High Precision Framework version v1.0.0 is compatible with the following versions of the Unity Editor: 2020.3 and later The High Precision Framework is not yet fully integrated with all of Unity's subsystems, such as physics and navigation mesh . See the dedicated page Known Limitations for more information. Introducing Universe Space When using the HP framework, the user will be introduced to two new components: The HPTransform and the HPRoot. The HPTransform acts similarly to the Transform we already know. However, rather than positioning an object in world space, it positions a GameObject in universe space, with double floating point precision. The HPRoot component translates objects positioned in universe space into world space, such that they can be displayed in the scene. It contains a TR (Translation-Rotation) which determines the point in the universe space that corresponds to the root’s position in world space. For example, if the HPRoot has the same TR as an HPTransform, the latter will be positioned, in world space, exactly on the former, with matching rotation and scale. Under most circumstances, the HPRoot’s transform will be set to the origin of the scene. However, there are exceptions. In the case of AR experiences, down-sizing a city contained in HP space and viewing it on a table could be achieved by scaling down the HPRoot and placing it at the center of the table. Rendering HP Space Being in double precision, the universe space can contain planet-scale scenes without needing to worry about precision issues. However, in order to be rendered, it must be translated back into world space. As we have seen in the previous section, the HPRoot controls this process and is the key to implementing various rebasing schemes which dynamically translate our universe space into world space. Static Rebasing Static rebasing is the simplest scheme whereby a single point in universe space is positioned near the origin of world space. This is implemented by setting the HPRoot’s TRS to the specified point of interest. Camera-Centric Dynamic Rebasing Dynamic rebasing is achieved by constantly adjusting the HPRoot’s TRS to a moving point of interest. This can be implemented using the LocalCoordinateSystem component to tie the HPRoot’s TRS to an HPTransform such as that used to position the camera. Local Vertical Coordinate System When rendering a planet, the definition of up depends on where you are standing on the planet. It is often more practical to keep the world space up vector aligned with the planet’s up vector by rotating the HPRoot’s TRS and aligning the HP space’s local up vector with the world’s up vector. An implementation of this is available through the LocalVerticalCoordinateSystem found in the UnityGeospatial framework. Constraints to the Hierarchy Some design constraints need to be taken into consideration when building out the scene’s hierarchy. Before using the HP framework, you should be familiar with the following design principles: An example of a simple HP hierarchy, where some objects are in HP space while others are only in world space. An example of a more complex hierarchy where GameObjects are used for the organization of the scene. An example of multiple HP spaces coexisting within the same scene. Unity Mathematics The HP framework uses Unity Mathematics . See the following page to help you do the transition."

    "keywords": "Try It With Our Sample Scene This guide will show you how to position GameObjects within a hierarchy using the high-precision framework. We will be using a sample scene part of the High Precision Framework package. This scene is composed of 3 assets hierarchy positioned far from each other. These three assets are parented under a single HPRoot and replicate the same hierarchy. Each of them are located to different position via the HPTransform Component assigned to each Geometry object. Location1 / Geometry is located close enough to the center of the world to be manipulated. Location2 and Location3 are so far from the center, it is impossible to manipulate them within the editor. They are outside the floating point range and demonstrate how you can create world with greater range. If you press play, you can easily transition from one location to an other via the buttons on the bottom left corner. 1 - Opening the Sample Scene First, lets open the sample scene. 1.1 - Create a new URP Project Within the Unity Hub, create a new project based on the URP template. 1.2 - Install the Package Install the high-precision framework package using the installation instructions . Once you have completed these steps, you will have the high-precision framework installed in your current project. 1.3 - Import the Samples In the package manager window (Window > Package Manager), select the high-precision framework package by clicking on it. By expanding the samples section, click on the import button. 1.4 - Open the Scene Open the newly imported Sample Scene Samples/High Precision Framework/v1.0.0/Sample Scene/Scenes/SampleScene 2 - Adding an Object to the Scene Now that we have everything setup, lets learn how the high precision framework works. 2.1 - Create a Sphere Create a sphere (GameObject > 3D Object > Sphere). Change its parent by moving it under the HPRoot / Location2 / Geometry GameObject. Set its position to zero (X: 0, Y: 0, Z: 0) 2.2 - Display the result Now, in the scene view, if you frame the sphere (F while the sphere is selected), you won't be able to see the geometry. The position of the parent is too far from the origin. 2.3 - Move the HPRoot Instead of manually modifying the sphere position from the inspector on play mode, we will do it in the editor with the gizmo. In the Hierarchy view, select the HPRoot / Location2 / Geometry game object. In the Inspector, make sure the HPTransform Coordinate System is set to Unity Default. Take note of the position value in the HPTransform. In the Hierarchy view, select the HPRoot. In the Inspector, enter the same position value for the HPRoot (-41546580, 0, 42773180) 2.4 - Move the Sphere Now, if you frame the sphere in the Editor view, you can position it by using the translation gizmo. 2.5 - Play Reset the root position to zero and hit play. You can click on the buttons to switch between camera positions."
