# High-Precision Framework

The High Precision (HP) framework allows Unity to render very large worlds by providing a standard way of addressing the limitations of the single-precision floating point system that is used to position and render GameObjects within the engine. For more information on the package, please see the full html documentation located in the Documentation~ folder.
